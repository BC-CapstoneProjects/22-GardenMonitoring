This is documentation for the code in this project.
BasicMovements.py - this is psudo code for how we are going to give our drone instructions through its path of scanning plants. from take off to landing.
DroneCommands.py - this is code for basic commands of getting the drone off the ground. this file was just a test to ensure that the drone was working and
that i could get a proper connection to it.(ran into some issues at first because after doing calibration on the app i didnt put the right propellers on the
correct motors. this caused an issue of the drone not being able to take off.)
Tello_OBJ-Recognition.py - code i found on youtube that will help with object recognition. might build our code on it, or take pieces of it and place into DroneCommands.py
